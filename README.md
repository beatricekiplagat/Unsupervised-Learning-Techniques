# Unsupervised-Learning-Techniques

#### 9/10/2021 

### Description

I am a data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and I am currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax).

My project has been divided into four parts where I will explore a recent marketing dataset by first performing an exploratory data analysis to understand the data, then I will carry out dimensionality reduction to obtain a set of principal variables. I will then an association analysis, to find relationships between the different items sold so as to be able to make recommendations for the customers based on whether they have similar items to boost Carrefourâ€™s sales. I will also check for anomalies on the available sales data.

The following are our metrics for success: 

- Cleaned data.
- Graphical representation of the relationships in the data as well as the distributions of the different variables in the data.
- Perform the different Unsupervised learning techniques as required.
- Sound conclusions and recommendations to Carrefour as per the analysis done.

The steps taken during this study are:

- Loading the data & needed packages.
- Exploring the dataset. 
- Cleaning the data. 
- Exploratory data analysis. 
- Implementing the solution for each of the unsupervised learning
techniques. 
- Conclusions & recommendations
